## About
Facify is a secure verification web-app that has a very simple working principle and usage.
It is built keeping in mind the present day rackets that take regularly. One such example
is stealing other people's subsidiaries like [Ration Card](https://nfsa.gov.in/portal/ration_card_state_portals_aa) duplicacy and another we can take
[LPG Gas Card](https://www.mylpg.in/) black services. Talking in terms of stats around [1.09Cr Fake Ration Cards](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/as-commoner-minister-busts-fake-ration-card-racket/) scandal in the state of West Bengal.
So we have proposed a easy-to-use come and go application where each individual gets validated and their entry is saved just through facial recognition.
So let's do a walkthrough of the product.
